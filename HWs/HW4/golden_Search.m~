% Script that runs the golden search algorithm to find the minimum of a
% certain function

% Inputs: 1) tol - error tolerance
%

function N = golden_Search(tol)

% initializes a and b at the end points of an certain interval  
a = 0; 
b = 2;
tau = (sqrt(5)-1)/2;

% initializes the number of iterations, N, at 0
N = 0;

% run the golden search algorithm until b-a is less than the tolerance
while (b-a) > tol
    % creates a point a certain distane from the lefthand side of int
    x1 = b - tau*(b-a);  
    % creates a second point equal distance from the
    x2 = a + tau*(b-a);
